# lmpy.randomize

Submodules under this module define randomization algorithms for matrices.  Matrix randomization is necessary in order
to measure the difference between the statistics of a matrix computed directly from research data 
against the statistics of a randomized version of that matrix.  The randomized matrix is created to have the same 
properties, such as size, values, row and column totals.  The difference between these statistics determines the 
statistical significance of the results.
