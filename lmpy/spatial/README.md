* lmpy.spatial

Submodules under this module define spatial indexes for faster operations to identify the geospatial relationships 
between geospatial features, such as nearest, intersection, and more.  An index is built on either a single 
geospatial vector file, in JSON or geo-JSON format, or a set of geospatial features in WKT format.
