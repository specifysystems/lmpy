# lmpy.data_wrangling.common

Sub-modules in this module are classes intended to bring common functionality to wrangling different 
types of data.  For example, many types of data need taxonomic resolution, and the 
lmpy.data_wrangling.common.accepted_name_wrangler._AcceptedNameWrangler_ is extended for occurrence, matrix, and 
tree data.
