# lmpy.statistics

The submodules here define different statistics that may be computed on matrices.

* **mcpa** MetaCommunity Phylogenetics Analysis (MCPA) brings together species
  distributions, with a phylogenetic tree of those species, and geospatial
  environmental values for the region of interest.  MCPA analyses reveal the
  relationships between the evolutionary paths of species, their distribution, and
  geospatial (i.e. geological, geographical) elements of the landscape.
* **pam_stats**: define different accepted measures and comparisons for a PAM matrix.
* **running_stats**: compute common values and objects used for computing a variety of
  matrix statistics, to avoid repeating common computations and reduce memory usage.
