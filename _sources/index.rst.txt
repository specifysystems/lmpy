Welcome to Lifemapper lmpy's documentation!
===========================================

The Lifemapper lmpy repository contains common Lifemapper objects that can be
useful to the community for either developing new tools for the
`BiotaPhy Python Repository <https://github.com/biotaphy/BiotaPhyPy>`_ or for
independent projects that want to use some of our performance and feature
improvements.

At the time of this first release, the tools are primarily for lightly wrapped
`Dendropy <https://dendropy.org/>`_ trees, extended
`NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ arrays that include header information, and
presence-absence matrix (PAM) randomizations that are used to create null
models.
